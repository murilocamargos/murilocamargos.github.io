## About

I'm an Electrical Engineering Ph.D. Candidate at the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG) working with data-driven incremental learning techniques applied to fault diagnosis prognostics in dynamical systems. I'm particularly interested in statistical and AI models that can extract knowledge from time-series recursively in a continuous learning scheme. I'm also a back-end developer very passionate about Python and DevOps with a B.S. in Systems Engineering.
